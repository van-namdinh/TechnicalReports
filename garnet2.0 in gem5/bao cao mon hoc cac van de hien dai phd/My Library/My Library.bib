In this paper, the NoC topology is designed which the fault tolerance function is enabled. Its dual-port network interface (NI) makes the key PE have two links with network at least, which can ensure high reliability of the system. The adaptive fault tolerant routing algorithm is also designed that could sense congestion on the network, and the routing nodes can well sense the congestion regions or error nodes on the network to work around the issues effectively. Experiment results demonstrate that the design proposed in this paper can ensure normal network communication and good system performance even if the congestion in routing nodes, communication links, processing elements, or any regions occurs.},

	abstract = {As technology scaling, reliability has became one of the key challenges of Network-on-Chip (NoC). Many fault-tolerant routing algorithms for NoC are developed to overcome fault components and provide reliable transmission. But proposed routing algorithms do not pay enough attention to find the shortest paths, which increases latency and power consumption. In this paper, a fault-tolerant routing algorithm using new component states diffusion method based on Farthest Reachable Router (FRR) is proposed. This algorithm can reduce latency by finding the shortest paths between source and destination routers. Experiment results verify that FRR routing algorithm can tolerate 79\% fault patterns within 3 × 3 and reduce latency by 16-44\% compared with FON.},

	abstract = {Network-on-Chips (NoCs) constitute a message-passing infrastructure and can fulfil communication requirements of the today’s System-on-Chips (SoCs), which integrate numerous semiconductor Intellectual Property (IP) blocks into a single die. As the NoC is responsible for data transport among IPs, its reliability is very important regarding the reliability of the entire system. In deep nanoscale technologies, transient and permanent failures of transistors and wires are caused by variety of effects. Such failures may occur in the NoC as well, disrupting its normal operation.

An NoC comprises a large number of switches that form a structure spanning across the chip. Inherent redundancy of the NoC provides multiple paths for communication among IPs. Graceful degradation is the property of tolerating a component’s failure in a system at the cost of limited functionality or performance. In NoCs, when a switch in the path is faulty, alternative paths can be used to connect IPs, keeping the SoC functional. To this purpose, a fault detection mechanism is needed to identify the faulty switch and a fault tolerant routing should bypass it. As each NoC switch consists of a number of ports and multiple routing paths, graceful degradation can be considered even in a rather granular way. The fault may destroy some routing paths inside the switch, leaving the rest non-faulty. Thus, instead of disabling the faulty switch completely, its fault-free parts can be used for message passing. In this way, the chance of disconnecting the IP cores is reduced and the probability of having disjoint networks decreases.

This study pursues efficient self-test and diagnosis approaches for both manufacturing and in-field testing aiming at graceful degradation of defective NoCs. The approaches here identify the location of defective components in the network rather than providing only a go/no-go test response. Conventionally, structural test approaches like scan-design have been employed for testing the NoC products. Structural testing targets faults of a predefined structural fault model like stuck-at faults. In contrast, functional testing targets certain functionalities of a system for example the instructions of a microprocessor. In NoCs, functional tests target NoC characteristics such as routing functions and undistorted data transport. Functional tests get the highest gain of the regular NoC structure. They reduce the test costs and prevent overtesting. However, unlike structural tests, functional tests do not explicitly target structural faults and the quality of the test approach cannot be measured. We bridge this gap by proposing a self-test approach that combines the advantages of structural and functional test methodologies and hence is suitable for both manufacturing and in-field testing. Here, the software running on the IP cores attached to the NoC is responsible for test. Similar to functional tests, the test patterns here deal only with the functional inputs and outputs of switches. For pattern generation, a model is introduced that brings the information about structural faults to the level of functional outputs of the switch. Thanks to this unique feature of the model, a high structural fault coverage is achieved as revealed by the results.

To make NoCs more robust against various defect mechanisms during the lifetime, concurrent error detection is necessary. Toward this, this dissertation contributes an area efficient synthesis technique of NoC switches to detect any error resulting from single combinational and transition fault in the switch and its links during the normal operation. This technique incorporates data encoding and the standard concurrent error detection using multiple parity trees. Results reveal that the proposed approach imposes less area overhead as compared to traditional techniques for concurrent error detection.

To enable fine-grained graceful degradation, intact functions of defective switches must be identified. Thanks to the fault tolerant techniques, fault-free parts of switches can be still employed in the NoC. However, reasoning about the fault-free functions with respect to the exact cause of a malfunction is missing in the literature. This dissertation contributes a novel fine-grained switch diagnosis technique that works based on the structural logic diagnosis. After determining the location and the nature of the defect in the faulty switch, all routing paths are checked and the soundness of the intact switch functions is proved. Experimental results show improvements in both performance and reliability of degraded NoCs by incorporating the fine-grained diagnosis of NoC switches.},

	abstract = {Due to the ongoing miniaturization of silicon technology beyond the sub-micron domain and the trend of integrating ever more components on a single chip, the Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has emerged to address the scalability and performance shortcomings of bus-based interconnects. As the feature size shrinks, the system gets much more susceptible to faults caused by wear-out and environmental effects. Thus, in order to increase the reliability, creates the need for having mechanisms embedded into such a system that could detect and manage the faults in run-time. In this paper, a ground-up approach from fault detection to fault management for such a NoC-based system on chip is proposed that utilizes both local fault management for fast reaction to faults and a global fault management mechanisms for triggering a large-scale reconfiguration of the NoC. Also, detailed description of strategies for fault detection, localization, classification and propagation to a global fault management unit are provided and methods for local fault management are elaborated.},

However, as dataset size and depth of the neural network architectures continue to grow, it is imperative to design high-performance and energy-efficient computing hardware for training CNNs. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing specialized CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore systems for energy-efficient training of CNNs. It has already been shown that the typical on-chip communication infrastructures employed in conventional CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms are unable to handle both CPU and GPU communication requirements efficiently. To address this issue, we first analyze the on-chip traffic patterns that arise from the computational processes associated with training two deep CNN architectures, namely, LeNet and CDBNet, to perform image classification. By leveraging this knowledge, we design a hybrid Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture, which consists of both wireline and wireless links, to improve the performance of CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms running the above-mentioned CNN training workloads. The proposed NoC achieves 1.8 reduction in network latency and improves the network throughput by a factor of 2.2 for training CNNs, when compared to a highly-optimized wireline mesh NoC.},

Experimental results show that the proposed technique decreases about 22\% latency of TSVs comparing with the worst crosstalk cases. This technique is applicable in the large-scale TSV array for it has a quasi-linear hardware overhead, and its system overhead is less than that of the 3-D 4-LAT counterpart if the data width is greater than 18, and it has good usability for it consumes less power per TSV and achieves lower bit error rate at the interested frequency range comparing with that of the original FNS coding technique.},

Its stage has changed from the research level or limited production level to the investigation level with a view to mass production. The 3D-LSI using through-silicon via (TSV) has the simplest structure and is expected to realize a high-performance, high-functionality, and high-density LSI cube.
