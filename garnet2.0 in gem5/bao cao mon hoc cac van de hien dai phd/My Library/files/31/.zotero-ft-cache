Abstract

Application mapping is one of the most challenging issues in designing Network-on-Chips, playing an important role in maximizing the performance of NoC based systems. This paper presents a novel method to map applications onto a targeted NoC architecture using Improved Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (IDPSO) algorithm. The NOXIM platform has been used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of latency, throughput, and power energy. The obtained results show that the proposed method can help the designers to get better performance for NoC based systems. This information is very useful for designers to decide how they should do in the next steps of designing a real-time system.
