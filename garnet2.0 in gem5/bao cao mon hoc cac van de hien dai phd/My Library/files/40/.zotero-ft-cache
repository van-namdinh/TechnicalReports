Abstract:
The growing reliance on intellectual properties exposes systems on chip (SoCs) to many security vulnerabilities and is raising more and more concerns. At the same time, with the quick increase in chip density and deep scaling of feature size, current billion-transistor chip designs introduce more challenges to manufacturing fault-free chips. In this paper, we propose an integrated run-time solution for both security and fault tolerance of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)-based SoCs through digital signatures, live monitoring, adaptive routing, and partial reconfiguration supported by an in-house-developed network on chip, X-Network. Our X-Network reduces the ratio of required routers versus processing elements with better performance, and more importantly, offers more flexibility than conventional networks to facilitate fault tolerance and security designs. A multiplexed Montgomery modular multiplication architecture is used to increase the speed of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm. The design has been implemented and tested on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA development board. Experimental results show that even if up to 20% of the links in the network are faulty, our reconfigurable architecture and algorithm manage to route packets around such faults, and deliver them to their destinations in a relatively low latency. Unlike conventional fault-tolerant methods that usually require resource redundancy, our design does not incur significant area or speed degradation. The resource overhead for both security and fault-tolerant features is around 10% more lookup tables.
