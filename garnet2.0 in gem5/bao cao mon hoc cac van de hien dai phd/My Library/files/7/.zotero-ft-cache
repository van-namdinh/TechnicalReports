Abstract:
As technology scaling, reliability has became one of the key challenges of Network-on-Chip (NoC). Many fault-tolerant routing algorithms for NoC are developed to overcome fault components and provide reliable transmission. But proposed routing algorithms do not pay enough attention to find the shortest paths, which increases latency and power consumption. In this paper, a fault-tolerant routing algorithm using new component states diffusion method based on Farthest Reachable Router (FRR) is proposed. This algorithm can reduce latency by finding the shortest paths between source and destination routers. Experiment results verify that FRR routing algorithm can tolerate 79% fault patterns within 3 × 3 and reduce latency by 16-44% compared with FON.
