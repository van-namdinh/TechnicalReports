Abstract:
Recently, the development of three-dimensional large-scale integration (3D-LSI) has been accelerated. Its stage has changed from the research level or limited production level to the investigation level with a view to mass production. The 3D-LSI using through-silicon via (TSV) has the simplest structure and is expected to realize a high-performance, high-functionality, and high-density LSI cube. This paper describes the current and future 3D-LSI technologies with TSV.
