\section{Target and Scope of the Project}
	%It should include something that explain the context of the research.
	In this report, I would like to focus on some of the following tasks:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How to run Gem5 to build an computer architecture such as ARM, X86, RISC-V.
		\item How to find out the saturation points of Network-on-Chip with diverse of benchmarks.
		\item Understanding of Garnet2.0 to applying on new ideas for doing my thesis

\subsection{Gem5 Simulator}
	The Gem5 simulator is a modular platform that can be used for computer-systems architecture research. Gem5 includes many features such as Multiple interchangeable CPU models, A NoMali GPU model, Event-driven memory system, A trace-based CPU model that plays back elastic traces, which are dependency and timing annotated traces generated by a probe attached to the out-of-order CPU model; Homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-core; Multiple ISA support; \textbf{full-system capability}; Multi-system capability; Power and energy modeling and Co-simulation with SystemC.
	
	All of the above features can reference from \href{http://gem5.org/Main_Page}{link-ref-for-Gem5 features in detail}
	
	In addition, Gem5 is also known as a modular discrete event driven computer system platform, in which can be understand via the following points:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The components in Gem5 can be changed and rearranged, parameterized, extended or replaced to suit our design.
		\item Gem5 simulates the passing of time as a series of discrete events.
		
	\end{enumerate}
